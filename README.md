### Distributed File Storage Using Golang 
A Scalable, Decentralized, Fully distributed, Content addressable file storage system using Golang that can handle and stream very large files.  
It covers TCP, peer to peer library, System Design, Low Level Programming and Network protocols.  

> ####Note
- This Repo is extension module of my personal project ```OWLs```, it will be one of important module of project, some changes are required in existing code, before taking it into production.  
- I'll leave this repo for new comers who want to learn the golang at it's peak. This is very good project if you want to learn golang by building complex systems, like this.
- I can add more and more features, like automatic peer discovery, automatic file recovery, Loadbalancers (to fetch files more fast as compared to peers), and more but it would take months and there will be still more features to add, so as beginner it is perfect to start with these, although the goal of this project is to explore and learn how such systems acutally work under hood.

### Features :- 
- Concurrency:     Utilize goroutines for handling multiple operations efficiently.
- Scalability:     Design for horizontal scaling to manage increasing data loads.
- Fault Tolerance: Implement data replication and failover mechanisms.
- Security:        Ensure data encryption and secure communications.
- Performance:     Optimize for low latency and high throughput.
