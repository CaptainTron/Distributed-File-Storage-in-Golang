### Distributed File Storage Using Golang 
A Scalable, Decentralized, Fully distributed, Content addressable file storage system using Golang that can handle and stream very large files.  
It covers TCP peer to peer library, System Design, Low Level Programming and Network protocols.  

### Key Points :- 
- Concurrency: Utilize goroutines for handling multiple operations efficiently.
- Scalability: Design for horizontal scaling to manage increasing data loads.
- Fault Tolerance: Implement data replication and failover mechanisms.
- Security: Ensure data encryption and secure communications.
- Performance: Optimize for low latency and high throughput.
